# LangExtract Features Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the advanced features of Google's LangExtract library that have been demonstrated and tested.

## ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. **Relationship Extraction**
- Groups related entities using attributes
- Successfully extracted medications with their associated conditions, dosages, and frequencies
- Used `medication_group` attribute to link related information
- Example: Grouped Lisinopril with hypertension and Metformin with diabetes

### 2. **Schema Constraints for Controlled Generation**
- Generates OpenAPI/JSON schemas from examples
- Ensures consistent output structure across extractions
- Successfully enforced attribute formats (e.g., currency, type, role)
- Schema automatically derived from example data

### 3. **Custom Prompt Templates**
- Created structured prompts with detailed instructions
- Incorporated multiple examples to guide extraction
- Used `PromptTemplateStructured` with custom descriptions
- Successfully rendered prompts with Q&A format

### 4. **Chunking Strategies**
- Tested different `max_char_buffer` sizes (500, 1000, 2000)
- Demonstrated how chunk size affects extraction results
- Smaller chunks found more granular extractions
- Larger chunks provided better context but fewer extractions

### 5. **Multi-pass Extraction**
- Tested with 1, 2, and 3 extraction passes
- Note: In testing, multi-pass didn't significantly increase recall
- Feature available for complex documents requiring iterative extraction

### 6. **Format Types**
- Demonstrated both JSON and YAML output formats
- Both formats produced consistent extraction results
- YAML format is default, JSON available as alternative

### 7. **Parallel Processing**
- Processed multiple documents concurrently
- Tested with different worker configurations (1, 5, 10)
- Successfully processed batches of documents
- Useful for large-scale document processing

### 8. **Additional Context**
- Injected external context to enhance extraction
- Successfully extracted date from context when not explicit in text
- Useful for providing document metadata or background information

### 9. **Custom HTML Visualizations**
- Created customizable HTML templates for extraction visualization
- Built-in templates: DarkModeTemplate, MinimalTemplate, CompactTemplate
- Full control over CSS, HTML structure, and JavaScript functionality
- Preserves core grounding and highlighting features
- Supports export functionality and custom branding
- Templates can be saved and reused across projects

## üîç Key Insights

### Grounding Capabilities
- LangExtract provides precise character-level position tracking
- Each extraction includes `char_interval` with start/end positions
- Alignment status indicates extraction confidence
- Enables exact source attribution

### Schema Generation
- Automatically creates schemas from examples
- Ensures consistent structure across extractions
- Supports nested attributes and complex types
- Compatible with Gemini's structured output

### Flexibility
- Works with multiple model providers (Gemini tested)
- Supports various document formats
- Customizable prompts and examples
- Extensible attribute system

## üìù Implementation Notes

### API Configuration
```python
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

### Basic Usage Pattern
```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash"
)
```

### Advanced Options
- `use_schema_constraints`: Enable structured output
- `extraction_passes`: Multiple extraction attempts
- `max_char_buffer`: Control chunk size
- `max_workers`: Parallel processing threads
- `additional_context`: Inject external information
- `format_type`: JSON or YAML output

## üöÄ Production Considerations

1. **Performance**: Use appropriate chunk sizes and worker counts
2. **Accuracy**: Provide high-quality examples for best results
3. **Cost**: Consider model pricing for large-scale extraction
4. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic for API failures
5. **Validation**: Verify extracted data against schemas
